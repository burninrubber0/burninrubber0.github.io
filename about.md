Certain things deserve more than a quick Bluesky post or Discord message, but don't belong on an informational sites like wikis. I tried putting stuff on Patreon (for free) but it just didn't feel like the right medium. So, I did what any self-respecting programmer does and made a blog.

I'll be posting about whatever's on my mind. Sometimes Burnout modding, sometimes other stuff, and not always guatanteed to be interesting. Expect posts to be infrequent.

If you're here looking for actual Burnout modding info, see the [Burnout Wiki](https://burnout.wiki). For help modding, see the [Burnout Modding](https://discord.gg/2AnCV7u) or [Burnout Hints](https://discord.gg/dMyuRBq) Discords.
